# URL Similarity Search System using ChromaDB
-----------------------------------------

In the digital age, dealing with broken or incorrect URLs is a common challenge that can lead to poor user experience and lost traffic. This project implements a smart URL matching system that helps users find the correct webpage even when they encounter typos or slightly incorrect URLs. By converting URLs into numerical vectors and using ChromaDB for similarity search, the system can quickly identify and suggest the most similar valid URLs from a website's sitemap. This approach is particularly useful for large websites where manually redirecting or finding correct URLs would be time-consuming. The system processes XML sitemaps to build its knowledge base, and when given a potentially incorrect URL, it returns the closest matches based on semantic similarity rather than just character matching, making it more effective at understanding user intent.

### Why this process is important

**1.- User Experience & Error Recovery**

*   Users often encounter broken links or mistyped URLs
*   Instead of showing a generic 404 error, we can guide users to the content they likely meant to access
*   Real-world example: A user types "motortrend.com/news/ford-mustang-review-2024" but the actual URL is "motortrend.com/news/ford-mustang-2024-review" - our system would redirect them to the correct page
*   This reduces user frustration and maintains engagement on the site

**2.- Content Migration & Legacy Support**

*   Websites frequently reorganize their URL structure or migrate content
*   Old bookmarks, external links, and search engine results may still point to previous URL patterns
*   Our system can help maintain continuity by:
    *   Finding the new location of moved content
    *   Handling various URL formats that might have been used over time
    *   Preserving SEO value from old links by providing relevant alternatives

**3.-Analytics & Content Management**

*   Understanding URL patterns and similarities helps content teams:
    *   Identify duplicate or similar content that might need consolidation
    *   Analyze how content is organized and accessed
    *   Track content evolution over time through URL changes
    *   Make data-driven decisions about content structure
*   Example: If many users are searching for "reviews" in different URL formats, it might indicate a need to standardize the URL structure for review content


This module implements a URL similarity search system that can:
1. Process XML sitemaps to extract URLs
2. Convert URLs into vector representations
3. Store these vectors in ChromaDB for efficient similarity search
4. Find similar URLs when given a potentially incorrect URL

The system is particularly useful for:
- Finding correct URLs when users mistype or remember URLs incorrectly
- Redirecting users to the closest matching content
- Analyzing URL patterns in a website

Requirements:
- chromadb
- numpy
- tqdm
- xml.etree.ElementTree
